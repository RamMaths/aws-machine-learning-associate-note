## Data Engineering Fundamentals

### Types of Data

#### Structured Data

- Definition: Data that is orgnizied in a defined manner or schema, typically found in relational databases
- Characteristics:
    - Easily queryable
    - Organized in rows and columns
    - Has a consistent structure
- Examples:
    - Database tables
    - CSV files with consistent columns
    - Excel spread sheets

#### Unstructured Data

- Definition: Data that doesn't have a predefined structure or shcema
- Characteristics:
    - Not Easily queryable without preprocessing
    - May come in various formats
- Examples:
    - Text files without a fixed formats
    - Videos and audio files
    - Images
    - Emails and word processing documents

#### Semistructured Data

- Definition: data that is not as organized as structured data but has some level of structure in the form of tags, hierarchies, or other patterns.
- Characteristics:
    - Elements might be tagged or categorized in some way
    - More flexible than structured data but not as chaotic as unstructured data
- Examples:
    - XML and JSON files
    - Email headers (which have a mix of structured fields like date, subject, etc and unstructured data in the body )
    - Log files with varied formats
